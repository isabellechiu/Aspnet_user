Now the weather is getting warmer I am able to get out and increase the length and intensity of my  Mountain Biking trips and I don't want to lose any more weight which I am teetering on the verge of.
 How do I stabilise my weight while still continuing on the LCHF diet.  I don't feel great hunger pangs  when exercising as I did before I started this diet.  i.e. last summer? 
My calorie expenditure is the same as last summer when riding so how do I maintain my present weight when I don't feel hungry?
Does anybody have similar experiences and a possible solution.
 Any help appreciated.

I have had two very good days, done lots of testing during the day and reading all between 5 and 7 (unheard of for me).  I reduced my insulin by 2 units last night.  BS at bed was 8.8, this morning it was 8.6, higher than the last couple of mornings.  I had porridge for breakfast with a small drop of honey and 2 hours later is 12.6 whats that all about?  Have I reduced my insulin, too much too soon?  Got blood test for A1HBC next week and will see diabetic nurse two or three weeks after that however when previously discussed low carbing she was not in agreement with it so unlikely to get too much support.  Any comments/views would be appreciated.

7274,212020,2,"Hunger, stress and sugar levels","My husband has recently made a huge effort to change his diet, reducing milk, fruit etc and is on pretty low carb. He had a variety of problems related to autistic spectrum disorders and ADHD which means I prepare most of his meals in order to keep the carbs low. His stress levels are usually very high (which will affect blood sugar levels) and he is very hungry much of the time. His sugars, whenever measured at the moment, are in the teens and I will be seeing the doctor to discuss further medication both to bring these levels down and to reduce his appetite. I aim to get his carbs under 40g net as much as possible and his protein is about 100g though this varies a bit more. Even at a normal weight my husband is a large and naturally muscley man. Fat makes up the rest of his food and is very high to try and help with his hunger. As yet I've seen no real change in the few readings he has taken, though prior to this this diet change he hasn't taken any for a long time. I am trying to take the long term view and believe his next HbA1c will be lower because his carbs are lower even though his calorie intake is way higher than the medical profession would be happy with. It's between 2500 and 3000 kcal. He is not well enough to work as he has a variety of ailments and is very inactive. I am also aware he is unlikely to lose weight because his energy intake is high but again, I am trusting that over the long term as his sugar and insulin levels drop, his body adjusts to fat burning then his hunger will reduce naturally. Even at this level he is trying hard to deal with hunger.  The healthcare professionals talk about portion control but if I cut down the portions then my husband will go looking for food because he is hungry. If you understand autism and ADHD you may understand this.  So, lots of background info, but is it reasonable to just push on with it believing that the biochemistry / metabolism will respond accordingly to reduce blood sugars, insulin and hunger over the long term?",21/03/2017 14:30,NULL,0,0

Can diabetes be managed on 2 meals a day?

Although having lost 2 stone over the past 3-6 months  I still have at least 2 stone still to lose.  I decided to run a few days testing my blood sugars and not being surprised these were in the range 9-17.   I have been following the low-carb programme and have introduced some exercise into my daily routine by walking for 1/2-1 hour 2-3 times a week.  I monitor my carbohydrates /  sugars to see how and what foods are having an affect on my levels of blood glucose and have introduced a low carb approach. From my recent investigations I have found that if restrict my food intake to 2 main meals a day 11am (breakfast) and 4 pm (main evening meal) I can retain my sugars over a reasonably normal range.  8.4-9.4 thats recording pre- post- and 2 hrs after meals.  It seems to work for me.  My only concern is the caloric intake and if I will be consuming sufficient calories over the 24 hour period.  Its early days however Ill use my weight change as an indicator for that one.  Is anyone else managing on this 2 meals per day schedule or am I setting up for problems ahead. - Thanks",05/07/2017 15:34,NULL,0,0

I am really hoping someone might be able to help me with the results I have been given today. 
I am coming to the end of week ten and I was called into my surgery to have fasting bloods done on Monday. The results I have been given are very scanty and I have been told by my new diabetic nurse, its &quot;all you need to know&quot;.
The results are HbA1c 6.7 (previously 7.7) Cholesterol 6.8 (have gone up from 5.7) and Triglycerides 2.6 (these also have gone up). 
My BP has gone down and my medication has been halved by my GP before this appointment.
The nurse has agreed that I can continue with the LCHF program until March when I have my annual review, but if  eating the LCHF way does not improve my cholesterol she will advise against it and recommend an increase in my statin dose.
I`m feeling a bit disappointed by the response. Although she said &quot;Well done for losing weight&quot;.
Am I doing ok or not? Would be glad if a more experienced person could help me.
Thank you so much.

8734,246504,38,"I tried to complete a survey on my progress, but when I click on submit it just says 'connencting'","So here are my answers to the questions:
What advice did your doctor give you? 
Keep to a balanced diet including boiled or mashed potatoes, whole meal bread and low-fat spread. Remember to take my pills with breakfast and evening meal. He said I must accept that diabetes is a progressive disease and as I get older will have to increase my medication at intervals. I followed his advice from when I was diagnosed in 2010 to June 2017 when I started the low-carb diet. I am now 75 years old.

What results have you seen since starting? 
I lost 14lbs (1 stone) in eight weeks, experimented with reducing my medication (4 Metformin &amp; 1 Glimepiride per day at the start) while monitoring blood glucose levels using my Nexus blood testing kit. Blood glucose levels did not rise; after 12 weeks in all I was taking no pills and relying solely on the low card diet. My doctor was very sceptical and insisted I take a fasting blood test. The result showed my HbA1c had plunged to 39 mmol/mol. In April this year it had been 69 mmol/mol so now it is at its lowest level since I was diagnosed. My doctor said he would cancel my prescription and asked me again for the name of Dr David Cavan and the titles of his books, as he wanted to recommend them to another patient.

Your program experience 
Coming off medication completely, reducing my weight by a stone and  waist measurement from 38&quot; to 36&quot;, feeling more alert and focussed.

Advice and tips 
Try to stick with it. If you check your weight every 3 days you will observe your weight loss and this will encourage you to persevere.

Lifestyle changes 
Since losing weight I have begun to walk more. I follow a circular route which avoids traffic pollution, and a brisk walking pace brings me back to my starting point in 45-50 minutes, slightly out of breath and starting to perspire. I do this most days weather permitting.

Going it alone? 
I am widowed and did it alone. This has the advantage that I can plan meals with no one else in mind, so I'm not tempted to buy or consume food I need to avoid (eg breakfast cereals, sandwiches etc)

The nutritional info is cal 256, Protein 30g, carbohydrate 18g, sugar 7g, fat 8g, saturates 2g.

Ingredients: 1tbsp sunflower oil, 1 onion, 1 garlic clove, 1 inch root ginger, bunch spring onions, 500g chicken breast, 2 tbsp mild curry paste, 450ml coconut milk, 300ml chicken stock, 250g dried egg noodles, 2tsp lime juice, salt &amp; pepper, basil sprigs

I&rsquo;m guessing that the 256 calories is for one portion (serves 4) and the carbohydrate is 18g for a single portion. Would this be considered an alright meal on the low carb programme. I know it&rsquo;s got noodles but 18g doesn&rsquo;t seem that many if I&rsquo;m allowed 120 per day.

Is it ok or am I not understanding things right:)

8827,242663,38,This is for Harry DCUK,"Hi there,

I have been feeling quite ill since 22 December with Bronchitis  aches shivers, thumping headache and the mother of all sore throats. I am very chesty. The 22nd I could put up with it as it was not to bad but by the 26th I had to go to bed. I have had Bronchitis before so I know that is what I have now. I feel very run down and it seems to be taking a while for me to get better. I am wondering if I am lacking in some nutrients. I used to eat plenty of fruit and some couscous, quinoa and black-eyed beans mixed with cucumber tomatoes red onion and feta cheese, drizzled with Virgin Olive Oil lemon oregano and basil as a dressing. Now of course The carbs that I have mentioned are no longer in my diet. I have also noticed a couple of weeks ago that my lips were getting very dry and have got worse,also my hands dry and sore.hair thining. I looked up Why are my lips so chapped and dry. ( I have never had this before) and it came up with deficiency of Potassium, Calcium and Sodium. Which it said is commom when somebody is in Ketosis I am eating all that I should be eating but minus what I mentioned to what I used to eat. I am now wondering if I should introduce a small portion of black eyed beans once a week, and Bulgur wheat or couscous once a week so only two days a week.I have heard that some people can eat this in very small moderation. I am no longer feeling healthy on Keto. Any advice. I will be booking an appointment to see the doctor on Tuesday because they are closed till then. I know that you cannot answer medical questions but just wondered your oninion on me trying small portion of grains and some blackeyed beans,they are low in carbs by the way. 4 grams per 100 gram which is more than I would eat,and 0 sugar. I am been diagnosed with high sugars not Diabetes. My sugars are fasting 5.7 or less within two hours of eating food 6.1 or less",30/12/2017 01:34,NULL,0,0

8840,297556,3,What should be the ideal Fat/Carb/Protein split for T1D on low carb diet?,"Hi,  one of  big motivators for going low carb in addition to better blood glucose control, is dealing with smaller doses of insulin there avoiding severe hypos due  to incorrect high doses when consuming high meal.

But, When consuming a meal with 14g Fat + 42g Carb,  the body was less sensitive to insulin for a longer period(2 days) leading to corrections with much higher dosage in these days. I am confused, how much of Fat can be ingested safely to avoid issues with insulin sensitivity.  This is one of the concerns i have with low carb diet. I have following questions and I hope some one can help me with answers.

   1. I understand fat delays absorption of carbs, lowering the GI. How long can we expect unsaturated fat(say from 15gms 3/4 avacado) to be metabolized after it is consumed? 2 to 3 hrs? or 10 hrs?.. 

  2. does triglycerides in blood after ingesting fat cause liver to be less sensitive to insulin?, if yes for how long?

3. What should be ideal split of Fat/Protein/Carb should I ideally aim to avoid dealing with increased insulin sensitivity for longer periods.

My nurse, upon diagnosis a year ago told me as a T2 I did not need a meter as I would not go low, and that was the purpose of taking readings (I am in UK). I ignored that advice, as ignorant of diabetes as I was at that time, it made no sense not to test. By habit I take readings 2hrs after my main meal only (as testing is expensive). Because, in a year, my hba1c has gone from 90 to 34, my nurse NOW seems a little more interested in me and accepts the fact i use a meter. However she said - take a reading after 4hrs, as it is important to see your readings when they should be at a normal level. She said that even her glucose as a non diabetic, would be high after a heavy meal, but a few hrs later hers might be 3.5 - 4.5%.

When arriving home looked on internet and found information to say that calorie counting isn't necessary and that too much protein can turn to fat/glucose which is why I think my weight loss has been nil this week.

No mention of whether I should be doing blood glucose testing - should I? Will it help me to get a handle on what works for me? What equipment do I need to get?
Any advice welcome as just can't get my head round things.",02/03/2018 15:29,NULL,0,0

I was totally shocked and felt panicked and confused as to where to start. I found your web page and it&rsquo;s been my bible ever since. On the fourth day on meds I began to feel really unwell and odd during the morning so much so that I thought I was going to pass out and I took my BG and it was 2, thanks to your page I realised it was a hypo and knew what to do, the same happened again in the evening so I rang the Dr and he said it was because I was doing the HFLC diet and had not eaten enough, well I wish he had told me that before. I came off the meds to try and control it myself and since then have followed the Low Carb Programme to the letter, unfortunately after 6weeks I&rsquo;m still having general readings of 7/8.5, I feel so disappointed that my BS isn&rsquo;t dropping, and slightly scared that I&rsquo;m doing myself damage, am I expecting too much too soon, or should I just give in and go back on the meds, I would appreciate any advise you can give me.

I couldn't have been more surprised. He is fully supportive of the LCHF lifestyle! He congratulated me on my weight loss and said my HbA1c was superb at 37mmol! I am in normal range for someone without diabetes!
My lipids have gone up and I asked if I should perhaps cut out some of the fats, to which he said &quot;I don't want you worrying about fats, it the carbohydrates we need to target. Go as low with the carbs as you want to, you will get what you need from all the food that you are eating!&quot;
I can't tell you how thrilled I am. I am going to be retested in six months and if my results remain this good, I will be taken off all my meds. Yeah!! He said he is certain that my numbers will be better again by that time. He also acknowledged how hard it is to go low carb, but said &quot;You are living proof it works&quot;.
I have had diabetes 20 years, this is just amazing.
Thank you so much for this program and to all those of you that have answered my questions.
I almost can't wait for the next six months!!!

9162,320077,3,Deflated ,"Hi guys, 

Had my 1st appointment today with the diabetic nurse 2 weeks after my initial results came back... 

I was explaining what I&rsquo;ve been doing pretty strictly to watching my carb intake and that I&rsquo;ve bought an accu chek just to see for my own mind if there has been any significant changes to my levels... 

The response I got was &ldquo; you&rsquo;ve wasted your money&rdquo; 

The only check that&rsquo;s important is the blood test in the practice... 

I got no advice as to what to eat, drink Ect but basically said wait until these 2nd results come back 

I&rsquo;ve been testing myself every morning after I&rsquo;ve woke up, twice during the day and 1-2 hours after evening tea and my figures are hovering around the 32 -36 mark..

From this I was feeling upbeat and actually enjoying the food intake shift from my normal crap to a hopefully healthy eating one 

May be nowt to be over thinking about but just feel pissed off with the nurse ",28/03/2018 16:29,NULL,0,0

I've been eating the suggested food including Quinoa to replace rice. I find Quinoa insipid and tasteless and the texture is awful. After some (online) searching I find that Quinoa (cooked/100g) contains 21% carbs. Canadian wild rice contains (cooked/100g) 21.3% carbs. This is much tastier with a lovely nutty flavour and has a great texture (if cooked correctly). Whilst it takes about 45min to properly cook and steam wild rice as against 15min, the result is much nicer.

I have been following the vegetarian meal plan but have looked at the 40 day low carb challenge. I am actually pescatarian and there are a lot of fish dishes on there. Also for the meat dishes of which there aren't that many, I could substitute a different meal or substitute quorn for the meat. I used quorn a lot prior to starting this diet. there seems more options for me that way. I will probably be having the same quick breakfast each day such as the raspberries and yoghurt and maybe batch up a couple of the soups for lunches as I don't really have time for food preparation all day.

Also what would be considered a consistently good range in order to consider stopping one of the tablets? I'll be discussing this with the nurse but I'm curious to know if and when we'll be able to make that decision. One of my greatest wishes is to get off all diabetic medication and maybe even reduce other meds as I'm also on thyroid, cholesterol and blood pressure tablets. If the low carb doesn't do the trick after a month or two, I'll be looking at intermittent fasting. I'm determined. I just have to watch I don't lose too much weight as I'm only 58kg now and don't really want to go much below 55kg. Anyone else come off meds at all?",13/06/2018 18:52,NULL,0,0
